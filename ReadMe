Most of the operations in the CHI electrochemical workstation can be realized automatically through the "Control-macro command" function in the CHI software. That is to say, except for operations such as changing the electrolyte, there is no need to be on the sidelines. We can save a lot of time and energy to do more meaningful things.
Take my own research direction, the electrochemical test of supercapacitor materials as an example. To test supercapacitors, we need to test the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve, constant current charge-discharge curve (GCD), AC impedance curve (EIS), and long-term stability test. These series of operations can be achieved through automated scripts. You The only thing to do is to prepare your electrode material and run your automated test script.
